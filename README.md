# FaceBot

FaceBot is a simple React project that displays a list of robot "users" in a card-based UI. It demonstrates React fundamentals, including components, props, state, and event handling. The app allows users to search through a list of robots, filtering the displayed cards in real time.

## Features

- **Robot Directory:** Browse a list of robot profiles, each with a unique avatar, name, and email.
- **Live Search:** Instantly filter robots by name using the search box.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, card-based layout with interactive hover effects.
- **Avatar Generation:** Robot images are generated using [robohash.org](https://robohash.org/), ensuring each robot has a unique look.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev/) (Functional and Class Components)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for basic styling

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facebot.git
   cd facebot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will open automatically in a new window.
