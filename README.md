# FaceBot

FaceBot is a simple React project that displays a list of robot "users" in a card-based UI. It serves as a fun demonstration of React fundamentals, including components, props, state, and event handling. The app allows users to search through a list of robots, filtering the displayed cards in real time.

## Features

- **Robot Directory:** Browse a list of robot profiles, each with a unique avatar, name, and email.
- **Live Search:** Instantly filter robots by name using the search box.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, card-based layout with interactive hover effects.
- **Avatar Generation:** Robot images are generated using [robohash.org](https://robohash.org/), ensuring each robot has a unique look.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev/) (Functional and Class Components)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for basic styling
